    # So, there's this technique called S-A-R-G, and the purpose of SARG is to allow LLMs to do better reasoning. And I wanted to extract a principle of how LLMs can be used from this paper. The idea is that you have this corpus of documents, and then you extract triples of cause, relation, and effect. You construct a causal graph, and from this causal graph, you have a query of why did XYZ happen. You can then use this causal graph to learn why that happened using an LLM. But I think that this is very obvious, and it shows that the purpose of an LLM is, if you have some data structure, and a human can look through that data structure and answer a question, then an LLM can do it. I think this is a powerful principle that can lead to other interesting research topics slash results.
